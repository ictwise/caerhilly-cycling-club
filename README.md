# UX
This site is intended for use by members and public who are interested in Caerphilly Cycling CLub and the rides and events hosted by the club.
No template was used to build this site. There were some specific UX and UI designs that were taken into consideration when styling this site. The footer was left off the desktop view to present a cleaner, more minimalistic approach to the design. By adding a footer in the desktop view, I would have risked an awkward contrast in colors to follow the transparent theme of the navbar. However, you can see the footer implemented on pages in the mobile and tablet view, since the background here is off-white. I also did not include it on any pages that are viewed to be 'an extension' of another. This was to create a continuous flow of the website, instead of making it constantly seem like you're going to a new page each time you click.
