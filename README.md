# UX
This site is intended for use by members and public who are interested in Caerphilly Cycling CLub and the rides and events hosted by the club.
No template was used to build this site. There were some specific UX and UI designs that were taken into consideration when styling this site. The original site looked old, tired and unprofessional. It did not reflect the vibrant nature of the club. I wanted to include some anamation, video images. There was an issue with responsiveness, the top navigation bar did not collapse on mobiles and took up most of the real estate on a mobile screen.
