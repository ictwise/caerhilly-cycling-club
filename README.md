# Caerphilly Cycling Club
Static responsive website - Stream 1 Project
I'm a member of Caerphilly Cycling Club. We have a servicable website, it's static, has not been changed in more than 5 years but generally the content is good. The main failing of the site is that it is not responsive. Given that during the last 5 years most users have moved from desktop to mobile devices to view the site this issue needs to be addressed.
From a design point of view the design is dated and does not reflect the dynamic nature of the group.

# UX

# Users stories
## Potential new club members
need to find out about the club - rides, how to prepare for a ride, how to join the club, what kind of riders already belong to the club.
## Existing club members
May need to check club rules. See information on club rides. See recent photos. Foster a sense of pride in the club.
## General public 
May want to contact the club to make complaints about club members road use.
## Public officials
Ask for advice from the club members and committee about policy decitions

# Design
No template was used to build this site althoughe some existing designs that were taken into consideration when styling this site. Specifically the Code institute 'Love running' site and the Bootstrap resume example. To reflect the vibrant nature of the club. I wanted to include some anamation, video images generally the feeling of movement. There was an issue with responsiveness, the top navigation bar did not collapse on mobiles and took up most of the real estate on a mobile screen. It was important the new design resolved this.
